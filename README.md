# vue-crud

This is a simple CRUD created with vue to represent a simple airline list.

The project has been created with vue-cli 3. 

As a style framework, BootstrapVue has been chosen as it provides a directive and component system very well suited for this example.

The coding style is based on Airbnb, but since it's using eslint + @vue/eslint-config-airbnb + prettier maybe some of the rules may be off. The intention is not being 100% accurate with one coding style but to provide a consistent style over all the written code.
